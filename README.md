## About

AIrene is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices, written in Dart using Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework.

The app is designed to promote mental well being, utilising a chatbot to interact with users in a friendly, conversational manner.

Users can log moods, activities and achievements in their day using the chatbot, which responds appropriately according to mood. Further features include a diary and reports on moods for each day recorded, allowing users to identify trends. The app also features a breathing exercise, and a page for further wellbeing resources.
